##FizzBuzz Interview Question

Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be "Fizz".
If the number given is a multiple of 5, the output should be "Buzz".
If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be "FizzBuzz".
If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.
The output should always be a string even if it is not a multiple of 3 or 5
Examples
fizz_buzz(3) ➞ "Fizz"

fizz_buzz(5) ➞ "Buzz"

fizz_buzz(15) ➞ "FizzBuzz"

fizz_buzz(4) ➞ "4"

##Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci Sequence is the sequence of numbers (Fibonacci Numbers) whose sum is the two preceding numbers (e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, etc). Using 0 and 1 as the starting values, create a function that returns a list containing all of the Fibonacci numbers less than 255.

Examples
On generating a Fibonacci number where input is the two preceding values starting from 0 and 1 [0, 1, ...].

0, 1 ➞ 1

1, 1 ➞ 2

1, 2 ➞ 3

Notes:
This function will take no parameters.
